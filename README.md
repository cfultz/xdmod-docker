# xdmod-docker

This is a containerization of [Open XDMoD](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod). This started out as a project for work but after realizing it wasnt quite as easy to do, I figured "eh f*ck it" and put it up here as a CICD. Learning more about DevOps through just doing things, *typical Caleb*!


## Configuration of XDMoD once you have the container
``TODO``

## Issues with Open XDMoD
Those need to be reported to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod/pulls), not this one. This one literally pulls from there and builds, nothing more. I do not want nor have the time to work on their code. Plus, it's PHP... */me shivers*.
